# PasswordManager
Download the main.py file and run it. Make sure you change the VAULT_PASS value to something else. The vault will automatically be created and a file called 'NotVault.db' will be created. 
I'd recommend that you install the DB Browser for SQLite3 to have another way to access the Database.

DM me on Instagram (@macintushar) if you face any issues.

# WARNING: This Vault is barely secure.
